# Impact of sustainable investment on a business using ESG metrics: Towards an approach of ethical practices

## Description
This study aims to establish a pattern among the ESG fund integration and its impact on the Corporate Financial Performance. It also emphasizes the need for efficient sustainability reporting, which includes disclosure of ESG scores. The firms faced an increased demand to adopt and invest in ESG funds detailing their policies for the construction of an efficient portfolio. 

## Key Findings
1. The Multiple Linear Regression model showed a positive impact of ESG funds on the financial performance of the organizations, with around 84% variation in the 'sustainability score' explained by the model.
2. The Decision Tree model revealed that the ESG scores have significantly high importance and should be included in the portfolio reporting.
3. Random Forest model highlighted that the 'sector industrial' fund creates a huge positive impact on the 'sustainability score', which can be considered by investors while selecting performance metrics.
4. The Neural Network model achieved the highest accuracy with an RMSE of 0.01, indicating the most reliable prediction of 'sustainability score'.

## Methodology
1. **Data Understanding**: The study used data from Morningstar UK, a reliable source of financial data, containing information on European funds.
2. **Data Modeling**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Neural Network

## Conclusion
The study provides insights into the elements of ESG score and highlights the need for corporates to adopt sustainable business models for better portfolio construction. It supports the hypothesis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve and emphasizes the importance of ESG disclosure for firms to gain preference from investors and other entities.

## Future Scope
1. Investigating the weighted subcomponents of ESG performance separately concerning competitors.
2. Exploring a minimum threshold value as a benchmark for controversial firms to avoid a negative impact on the 'sustainability score'.
3. Analyzing the impact of ESG metrics on financial performance over a longer time frame.
